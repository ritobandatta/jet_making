Conditions:
R=0.2
algo=anti-kT
rapidity cut = 0.7
No  need to have pT cut for particle
The largest pT charged particle in a jet must have pT  greater than 5 GeV.

In order to run JET_READER.cc
Do this command 
"g++ -std=c++11 JET_READER.cc -o JET_READER \
    $(/Users/ritobandatta/fastjet-install/bin/fastjet-config --cxxflags --libs --plugins)

./JET_READER
"
Assuming fastjet-install/bin folder is located at /Users/ritobandatta/fastjet-install/

In WSU grid, first we need to load the module by "module load fastjet/3.4.0"
Once loaded the trick to run would be
 "
g++ -std=c++11 jet_maker.cc -o jet_maker\ $(/wsu/el7/gnu7/fastjet/3.4.0/bin/fastjet-config --cxxflags --libs --plugins)$
"
"jet_maker.cc" is especially made for running and making jets in wsu grid, though the command doesn't yet make use of job submission. This would surely be a thing to be done in future.
